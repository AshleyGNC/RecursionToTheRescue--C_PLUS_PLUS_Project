# RecursionToTheRescue--C_PLUS_PLUS_Project
This project uses Recursion and Data Structures like Maps, Sets, Vectors, and Graphs to solve two different problems

Problem 1: Doctors Without Orders 

 * Given a list of doctors and a list of patients, determines whether all the patients can
 * be seen. If so, this function fills in the schedule outparameter with a map from doctors
 * to the set of patients that doctor would see.
 *
 * @param doctors  The list of the doctors available to work.
 * @param patients The list of the patients that need to be seen.
 * @param schedule An outparameter that will be filled in with the schedule, should one exist.
 * @return Whether or not a schedule was found.



Problem 2: Disaster Planning 

 * Given a transportation grid for a country or region, along with the number of cities where disaster
 * supplies can be stockpiled, returns whether it's possible to stockpile disaster supplies in at most
 * the specified number of cities such that each city either has supplies or is connected to a city that
 * does.
 * This function can assume that every city is a key in the transportation map and that roads are
 * bidirectional: if there's a road from City A to City B, then there's a road from City B back to
 * City A as well.
 *
 * @param roadNetwork The underlying transportation network.
 * @param numCities   How many cities you can afford to put supplies in.
 * @param locations   An outparameter filled in with which cities to choose if a solution exists.
 * @return Whether a solution exists.
